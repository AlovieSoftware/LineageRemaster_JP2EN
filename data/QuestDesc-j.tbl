Do you want to move to the hunting grounds?(Y/N)
Is this the place where the Earth Dragon Antharas lives? The air is kind of heavy...
Deporozhu, I feel an unearthly powerful force coming from under the ground.
Don't let your guard down. The Earth Dragon Antharas is not an easy opponent to fight.
You've come this far. Way to go, Deporozhu!

Defeat Murian who threaten people in the Spider Cave North of Claudia.
Recently, everyone in the village has been attacked by spiders and is frightened. Could you please investigate?

You've been dealing with some vicious spiders, haven't you? You're getting pretty good at fighting them, aren't you?

In order to become as strong as Deporozhu, you must listen to me, your master!
Why the half-fish are going crazy.

Defeat the vicious half-fishmen that inhabit the Northeast of Claudia.
There's something wrong. Not only the spiders, but even the half-fish are becoming more and more violent.
We have to stop the half-fish from running wild and find out why they've gone crazy.
Is this...? Was the shard filled with dark energies inside the half-fishman's body?
This much magic is not the work of an ordinary dark wizard. No way...!
Obtain 5 Black Shards
Okay, that's enough chatter. The last exercise for today is to attack that scarecrow over there and get to level 5. Easy, right?
Suspicion
Examine the Orcs

Brave sir! I'm suspicious of the orcs that are performing the totem ritual. Could you please bring me some of their totems?

What the...? The name Kelenis came from the mouth of the King of the Dead?

Defeat King of the Dead

Ginos, Guardian of the Earth
You must cleanse the underground world of the corrupted guardian Ginos.
Use the Detection Scroll to defeat Ginos in the underworld south of Claudia.
I'm sorry to impose on you such a troublesome request. But I'm pretty sure it was Kerenis, and I can't leave it any longer.
Seeing that there was no response from the guardian gods, Kerenis' magic must have already affected him to that extent.
You must go to the underground cave south of the village to meet Ginos, the guardian of the earth.
So...Kerenis's magic power has reached a level where it can corrupt even the guardian of the earth...!
That means the other guardians are in danger...
Defeat Ginos
Don't you dare regret challenging me here! My servant, make them disappear!
Saku, Guardian of Water.
You have to purify Saku, the guardian of water, in the swamps east of Claudia.
Defeat Saku while using the antidote potions.

Saku's poison is very dangerous. Take this cyanide potion!
Brave Master! I haven't been able to reach the elders of my village for days. I've been going to the temple of Einhasad every day to offer my prayers...
I am worried that I might be involved in some kind of incident there. Please protect the elders. I beg you.
Take down Saku.
Drag the potion to the F5 shortcut window at the bottom of the screen.
Go to the Temple of Einhasad.
Defeat the spirit kings of the four elements.
The key to the Einhasad Temple is in the possession of the fallen spirit kings. You have to defeat them to get the key to the Einhasad Temple.
Wait! The Temple of Einhasad isn't open to everyone. You'll need a key to get there.
The key is in the possession of the spirit kings who guard the temple. However, it is highly likely that they too have already been corrupted.
You must put them out of their misery and make your way to the Temple of Einhasad.
So you got the key! I hope the elders are safe... go to the temple and find them!
Defeat Earth Spirit King.
Defeat Water Spirit King.
Defeat Wind Spirit King.

Thank you for your help.
The Temple of Einhasad in the Darkness
Cleanse the dark air that spreads in the Einhasad Temple.
The Temple of Einhasad is originally a sacred place dedicated to Einhasad, the God of Life, and his five children. You must cleanse the temple of the darkness caused by the dark wizard Kerenis.
Damn it! Kerenis why do you want the power of the Temple of Einhasad!
How dare you defile this place, you dark wizard... ugh!
Elders! Pull yourself together! Oh, no... why... why would the Elder...
Ha-ha-ha! You made it this far, didn't you? But I'll take all the magic power here.
Hey! Kerenis is going to absorb all the power in the Temple of Einhasad! We have to defeat her!
Even though he's a Death Knight with incomplete power, he's still able to defeat her... that's pretty impressive!
But I've already gotten all the magic in this place. My last present is waiting for me at Claudia's castle, so stay tuned. Hahahaha!
Defeat Death Knight.
This time, I'm going to teach you about magic, a powerful tool that can turn the tide of battle.
Defend Castle Claudia.
Destroy the Guardian Tower in Claudia Castle.
The evil Dark Wizard Kerenis' goal is to corrupt Claudia completely. Her evil hand has reached Claudia Castle. Head to Claudia's castle and destroy the Guardian Tower, which contains her magical power.
Welcome, my friend. I'm sorry to hear about the elders but you must pull yourself together.
I didn't know that Kerenis was targeting Claudia's castle as well. I'm not sure how a single soldier can withstand her magic power, which even the guardian gods couldn't withstand.
Go to Claudia Castle with like-minded heroes and stop the evil plot of Kerenis!
Well done! Our losses were not small, but we held Claudia Castle!
It seems that there is nothing more I can teach you. You must leave here and travel to the wider world where a greater challenges awaits you.
Master Brave, please wait! I will concentrate my power into the divine magic crystal and what is waiting for me.
Obtained Claudia's proof.

So, you're Gunther's apprentice, huh? Let's see what you can do.
A perfect test for a brave warrior like yourself! Kill 20 Alligators, Crabman, and Trogs each. This should be no problem for you, right?
Hahaha... you're Gunther's apprentice? Can I ask you a favor?
Kill the giant monsters you see over there and bring me their skin.
These are the materials I need for my magical research. You can help me, can't you?
Haha... you are indeed Gunther's apprentice. 
Now I can continue my research, thank you.
Haha... you're Gunther's apprentice? I have one favor to ask. You see those huge monsters by the water? Their skins can be used to create the magic I'm working on. How about you help me with that?
Whoa! There's a dwarf... 
A little more... whoa! You scared me!
Not my father, but the elders told me to bring it over, but I can't do it by myself. I was wondering if you could help me.
Oh, my God! You brought it already? You're are brave!
Brave warrior, the elders told me to bring dwarf items, but I don't think I can do it alone. I was wondering if you could help me?
I'm wondering what kind of materials are used to make the equipment those orcs are wearing.
Do you think we can get it by defeating them? I think you can do it.
Good job! Watching you grow little by little reminds me of Deporozhu.
You see those orcs? They're monsters that wear armor like humans and fight in packs. We need to see what kind of technology they use to craft their equipment. Bring me their equipment.
Do you see the undead resurrected by evil magic...
We must investigate the true nature of the evil magic that the dark forces have gathered.
Bring me the equipment they're wearing. We need to see what kind of curse is on them.
Well done... let's find a spell that can free them from their dark chains.
It seems that the power of evil magic has become a curse that keeps the dead alive. Please free them from the curse. Perhaps the equipment they are wearing is cursed with magic.
Well, I see Wild Fang. I remember when I first came to Claudia, the first monster I killed was Wild Fang.
Wild Fang's skin is light and suitable for equipment.
Go and collect their skins. I'll make a belt out of the skins and give it to you.
Hahaha, you're pretty good. Here, let me give you a belt. You can try it on.
Wild Fang skins are light and suitable for making equipment. Once you've killed them, you can process their skins into belts.
Whoa!
Are you surprised? In that forest, Bear and Tiger are fighting for the title of King.
Can you go take a look and see who's likely to win?
I'm sure Bear and Tiger will get along well from now on. Thank you very much.
Bear and Tiger are fighting to see who is more worthy of being the king of the forest. Can you go and have a look at them to see which one is likely to win?
Shh! This is the cave where the werewolves live. They attack us with their sharp claws.
I'm thinking of using those claws to make a weapon... what do you think, do you think you can get them?
They're sharper than I thought they'd be! Well, I liked it. It's going to make a great weapon!
Werewolves use their sharp claws to deliver powerful blows. I'm thinking of making a weapon out of their claws, do you think I can get one?
I heard a rumor that a giant Ant Queen has been haunting this area. They are supposed to be living quietly underground, but...
It's a shame, but... if you find the Ant Queen, can you take her down so she can't come up to the surface?
You can't miss the danger that is coming to Claudia.
Thank you for your time. Ant Queen won't be coming to the surface again, will she?
The giant Ant Queen is the reigning queen of the underworld. We don't know why the Ant Queen has come to the surface, but if we leave her alone, her minions, the Spiders, will also follow the Queen and invade Claudia. Please send the Ant Queen back to the underworld!
The lizardman over there is also a potential threat to Claudia.
Remember the training I taught you and fight them off. It won't be difficult.
Defeat them and bring me the proof.
Well done. You're better than I thought you'd be.
Lizardmen are a race that moves in packs like orcs. If their numbers increase, they can become a threat to Claudia. Kill them and bring me the proof.
You see that alligator in the swamp? The skin of that alligator is light and of good quality.
I need to remake my current leather shoes...
Can you take them down and bring me the skins?
That's all I need, thanks!
The alligator skins in the swamps are of good quality. I'd like to remake my current leather shoes... can you bring me some of their skins?
Oh, the spirits...
He is the Guardian protecting Einhasad.
In its contaminated state, it would no longer be able to protect Einhazard.
I need you to... cleanse them.
How could this happen...Bless them, and thank you.
This is what happened...the spirits that protect the goodwill have been contaminated...in their contaminated state, they will no longer be able to serve as Guardians of the Temple...defeat them and purify them.

You have to gain various experiences to become a hero.
No success without effort!

Collect swamp crocodile leather in the depths of the swamp.
Another thing to watch out for in swamps is the swamp crocodile that hides and attacks you. The goal of this training is to be able to respond to surprise attacks.
The swamp alligator attacks while hiding himself, aiming for the opponent's gap.
In particular, it is bad to be hit by an unpredictable attack with your foot in the swamp.
If you can overcome the training that assumes that situation, no one will attack you.
There is something that you can never find a chance.
