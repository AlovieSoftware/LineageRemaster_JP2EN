		A part of the castle that disappeared from the continent of Aden after the unexplained change was found on the other side of space-time.<br/>
		Of course, those from another world are also on the lookout.<br/><br/>
		As a result of the investigation by the starting lineup...<br/><font fg="ffffaf">approximately once every two weeks, around 21:30 on Sunday</font> the cracks that connect to space-time are activated. If you aim at that time, you can go beyond space-time through the cracks.<br/><br/><br/>
		You can always send it near the crack, but make sure you know when it will activate.<br/>And in an unstable situation <font fg="ffffaf">those who make a gap will be nearby.</font> Be careful if you have many enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
